ðŸŽ¥ [The Mess We're In](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKXe3HUG2l4) is a talk by Joe Armstrong, a co-creator of Erlang, at Strange Loop conference. It's about complexity of modern system, about that chaos of duplicated and unreliable components that barely work.

The talk is 9 years old. Joe Armstrong died in 2019. Strange Loop conference will happen in this year last time. And yet the problems he covers are even more pronounced today and will stay true until the fall of humanity.
