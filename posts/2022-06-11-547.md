[LISP in Space](https://corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/) is a cool episode of [CoRecursive](https://corecursive.com/) podcast about automating spacecrafts with LISP, when the automation was just making its way into the field. I won't spoil too much, just listen to it.

I listened a few more episodes of the show. I also can recommend [The Original Remote Developer](https://corecursive.com/remote-developer/), a story of the guy who made the first graphical text editor for Apple leaving alone in a cabin in a forest.
