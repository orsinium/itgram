Today I learned that Amsterdam's administration [has over 300 open source projects](https://github.com/Amsterdam). Nothing interesting for me in the projects itself but I found a few short and simple but good style guides:

+ [How to code for humans](https://amsterdam.github.io/guides/code-for-humans/)
+ [How we code Python](https://amsterdam.github.io/guides/style-guide-python/) 
+ [How to write a README](https://amsterdam.github.io/guides/write-a-readme/) 

Their example of flake8 config is a bit mess but otherwise it looks neat.
