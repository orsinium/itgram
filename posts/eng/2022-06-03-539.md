[awesome-bugs](https://github.com/Julian/awesome-bugs) is a collection of articles about non-trivial bugs. It has such classic anecdotes as "Open Office Won't Print on Tuesdays" and "We Can't Send Email Farther Than 500 Miles" but also goes beyond that. Fun reading. It misses some famous ones, though, like [Therac-25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therac-25) scanner story, "the deadliest bug".
