ðŸ”§ [onefetch](https://github.com/o2sh/onefetch) is a little tool to show some basic stats about a git repo: authors (and percent of code contributed), commits, lines of code, languages, size. And that's it, really. Not much, but it's quite easy to install and quick to run (Rust at its best), unlike some other alternatives I tried before.
