ðŸ“„[Back to the '70s with Serverless](http://evrl.com/devops/cloud/2020/12/18/serverless.html) is an interesting rant about serverless, mostly about slow feedback and hard debugging. From my recent experience I can confirm, if you can't run the project 100% locally, it will sink a lot of your time each time you need to test, debug, experiment, observe. Welcome into the world of tomorrow ðŸ‘€
