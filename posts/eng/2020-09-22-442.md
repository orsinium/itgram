[Pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) is an alternative Python static type checker from Microsoft, written on TypeScript. The main difference from [MyPy](http://mypy-lang.org/) is "watch mode" that runs type checks only for the changed parts of the code. That means, faster for local development and better for IDEs.

[Pylance](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release) is a new VS Code extension and language server for Python from Microsoft, empowering the main Python extension. It's built on top of pyright. Features: fast, knows a lot about types (hence better code discovery, go to definition, documentation pop-ups), semantic syntax highlighting, auto-import, running type checks as-you-type (VS Code can't run Flake8 without saving file yet, AFAIK). See [announce](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/announcing-pylance-fast-feature-rich-language-support-for-python-in-visual-studio-code/) and [changelog](https://github.com/microsoft/pylance-release/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more features. Or just give it a try.
