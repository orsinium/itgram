[How we got to LiveView](https://fly.io/blog/how-we-got-to-liveview/) is a long read from Chris McCord, the creator of the [Phoenix web framework](https://phoenixframework.org/) for Elixir. It covers his experience with Ruby on Rails, what issues it had, how he fixed it in Phoenix, and then covers how LiveView is a continuation of these ideas.

Yes, I'm telling a lot here about Elixir, and I know that nobody cares. Still, I hope one day when you start a highly-concurrent and soft-realtime project with enough freedom to choose the tech stack, you may remember all my stories about Elixir, and give it a try. It's a relatively young language, but it is built on a very solid foundation and many great ideas.
