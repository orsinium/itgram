I made a thing.

üêöüîß [logit](https://github.com/life4/logit) is a CLI tool that takes JSON logs from stdin and transfers them into google cloud, AWS, syslog, sentry, anywhere you want, or just nicely formats them. 

It all started from idea that an application should have only business-logic in it. Later, I faced an application that has a lot of code to handle logging into GCP, which is unstable and hard to maintain. And at some point that application started to break everything because google cloud library uses grpc, networking, all that stuff that rest of the application isn't need. And it all started to go wrong because the network is unstable, grpc breaks multiprocessing, not every environment (for instance, CI) has access to google cloud and so on. In short, a lot of headache just to log things. So, if you don't want to get there, consider using logit or [rsyslog](https://www.rsyslog.com/).
