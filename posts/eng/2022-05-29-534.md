Let's talk about type checking of Elixir. No-no, it's no a channel about Elixir yet but I still want to write down some of the research I do in the language.

+ [Dialyzer](https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dialyzer.html) is an Erlang type checker. It's very forgiving and so not so helpful as most of other type checkers in other languages. You can read more about it in [Type Specifications and Erlang](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/dialyzer) section of "Learn you some Erlang". For Elixir, it is integrated in Elixir language server and also available as [dialyxir](https://github.com/jeremyjh/dialyxir) convenience wrapper.
+ [Gradualizer](https://github.com/josefs/Gradualizer) is a new type checker for Erlang, more strict and gradual. It's still in Alpha but looks promising. For Elixir, it's available as [gradient](https://github.com/esl/gradient).
+ [TypeCheck](https://github.com/Qqwy/elixir-type_check) is an Elixir library to check types at runtime.
