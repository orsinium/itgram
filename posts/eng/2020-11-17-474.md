**# Algebraic effects**

1. One year ago I posted ðŸ“„ [Algebraic Effects for the Rest of Us](https://overreacted.io/algebraic-effects-for-the-rest-of-us/) ([the post is here ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º](https://t.me/itgram_channel/333))

2. On the last weekend I read ðŸ“„[Why PLs Should Have Effect Handlers](https://robotlolita.me/diary/2018/10/why-pls-need-effects/). It's a bit older article but simpler and shorter. And it remind me about the topic...

3. Today I released [eff](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/eff) â€” a small and simple Python library to work with algebraic effects. It is a true "pythonic" library, with context managers, metaclasses, type annotations, and global variables ðŸ™ƒ
<https://github.com/orsinium-labs/eff>

It's a part of "orsinium-labs" where I do quick experiments. Maybe, someone will find this experiment interesting and maybe even helpful. Since it's a very small library, I consider it "production ready". Have fun!
