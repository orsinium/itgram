🐍 [vsketch](https://github.com/abey79/vsketch) is a Python library for generating art for a pen-plotter. Pen-plotter is like a printer but it uses a regular pen to draw the requested picture. You can send on it any svg image you like. And vsketch is a library to generate such svg.

[📄 Generative Art Python Tutorial for Penplotter](https://www.generativehut.com/post/generative-art-python-tutorial-for-penplotter) is a good article on how to use vsketch. And in general, the website is dedicated to generative art (when you write art as code instead of directly drawing in a visual editor, often with some level of randomization) and has a bunch of good articles about the topic. So, have a look at [tutorials](https://www.generativehut.com/tutorials) and [pen plotters reviews](https://www.generativehut.com/tools).
