[noclip.website](https://github.com/magcius/noclip.website) is "a digital museum of video game levels". It contains levels from different games from different platforms rendered online with WebGL. Very interesting. For instance, now I know that the mirror floor in "Hotel Ocean View" from GTA Vice City is, in fact, a half-transparent floor containing a mirrored copy of the room below. Mirrors in most of videogames is a lie.
