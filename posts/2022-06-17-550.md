ðŸ”§[scc](https://github.com/boyter/scc) is a very fast and simple CLI tool for calculating lines of code in a codebase. It supports multiple languages and additionally implements an interesting stat about how many engineers, months, an money is needed to re-implement the project from ground-zero. What's interesting, I've tested it on some of our internal projects, and the result is surprisingly accurate, something like Â±5%. The big difference from most of other similar tools is the support for modern languages (like Go) and `.gitignore`. Oh, and performance is amazing.
