[httpstatuses.io](https://httpstatuses.io/) is a cheat sheet with HTTP status codes. I wish it were just in man pages by default like ASCII characters table (try typing `man ascii` and you'll see what I mean). Maybe, I can send a feature request int <https://httpstatuses.io> repo to return something CLI-friendly when requesting a page from cURL.
