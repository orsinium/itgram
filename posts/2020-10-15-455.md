[no-color.org](https://no-color.org/) is a small initiative to motivate software to use one standartized way to disable colored output. In particular, it says "Please, disable color when `NO_COLOR` env var is set". So, please, when you'll make a new CLI tool, add support for `NO_COLOR`. And I promise to do the same.

#cli
