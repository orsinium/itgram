Ah jira, here we go again... I joined a new team, and there is Jira for tracking tasks. So, let's re-learn how to survive.

[🐚 go-jira](https://github.com/go-jira/jira) is a CLI client for Jira. It can do a lot: browse, search, create, manage, assign tasks.

🐚 [micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) is like nano but a bit bigger. It is a CLI text editor with friendly hotkeys and interface. I haven't used to vim, and work with go-jira is a bit faster if you edit the text without leaving the terminal. Of course, you can just use gedit/pluma/vscode as your [$EDITOR](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/77091).
