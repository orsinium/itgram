[sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) — чудесная библиотека для генерации summary (краткого содержания) для текста, причем поддерживает разные языки. Внутри 8 алгоритмов, которые просто работают, без обучения жирных нейросетей на кластерах и танцев с бубнами. Качество текста на выходе варьируется для разных текстов и алгоритмов, но в целом получается очень круто.

Давно хотели прочитать Lord of the Rings в оригинале, но всё не доходили руки? Ничего страшного, вот вам пересказ, сгенерированный по алгоритму Эдмундсона:

And  in that moment all the trumpets  were  blown, and the King Elessar went  forth  and came to the barrier, and  Horin  of the Keys thrust it back; and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear voices the  King passed through  the flower -laden streets,  and  came to the Citadel,  and  entered  in;  and the banner  of  the Tree and the Stars  was unfurled  upon the topmost tower,  and  the reign of King Elessar began,  of which many songs have told.

In his time  the City was made more fair than it had ever been, even in the  days of  its first  glory;  and it  was  filled  with  trees  and  with fountains, and its gates were wrought of mithril  and steel, and its streets were paved  with white marble; and the Folk of the Mountain laboured in  it, and the Folk of the Wood rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made good, and  the  houses were filled with men  and women  and  the laughter of children,  and no window was blind nor any courtyard  empty;  and after  the ending  of  the Third  Age of  the world into the  new  age it preserved the memory and the glory of the years that were gone.

The slow voices of the Riders stirred the hearts even of those who did not  know the speech of that people; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of the Mark as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the North and the voice of Eorl crying  above the battle upon the  Field of Celebrant; and the  tale  of  the kings rolled on, and the  horn  of Helm  was  loud in the Then a minstrel and loremaster stood up and  named all the names of the Lords of the Mark in their  order: Eorl the Young;  and Brego builder of the Hall; and Aldor brother of Baldor the hapless;  and Frja, and  Frjawine, and Goldwine, and Djor, and Gram (о, да это же я); and Helm who lay  hid in Helm's Deep when the Mark was overrun; and so ended the nine mounds of the west-side, for in that time the  line  was  broken,  and after came  the  mounds of the  east-side: Frjalaf,  Helm s sister -son, and  Ljofa, and Walda, and Folca, and Folcwine, and Fengel, and Thengel, and Thjoden the latest.
