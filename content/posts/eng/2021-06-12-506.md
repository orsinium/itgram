ðŸ”§ [task](http://taskfile.dev/) is an amazing alternative to make. I use it all the time and it is 10 out of 10. Simple configuration, easy to install, supports dependencies between tasks, watch mode, skipping jobs when a file wasn't changed, shared configurations, simple templates. Another one beautiful CLI tool on Go. Give it a try.
