Let's talk about the channel language. As [the poll](https://t.me/itgram_channel/439) shows, for most of the subscribers there is not much difference between Russian and English content. However, there are still many people who would prefer Russian. The results are biased because it always was Russian channel targeted to Russian-speaking audience. So, there is the deal:

+ The channel will be switched to English as the primary language.

+ If I encounter an amazing Russian article, I'll still share it with ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º label.

+ For Russian-only speakers there is not much help from short Russian descriptions for English articles and tools (how it was before). So, for you, I'll try to start a Russian-speaking podcast with short summary of tools and articles I posted over the week.

I hope it will help to share more amazing content with more people without leaving anyone behind. Stay tuned!
