[Testing in 2021](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2021/05/15/Testing-in-2021) is a collection of good thoughts from one guy on testing. Very good thoughts. Without extremes and fanaticism, which is rare nowadays, especially in mainstream articles. Everyone says something "the only working testing is TDD" or "pyramid of testing is complete garbage". Stop making a religion from it. We need to get better at testing than we are now but think with your head, don't make dogmas. Oh, and the article also deserves a bonus point for having an audio version.
