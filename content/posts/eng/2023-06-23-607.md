[Go 1.21rc1](https://go.dev/blog/go1.21rc) is released! It's not a final release yet, but we already can see what new features will be there, and that's huge:

1. Built-in function `min`, `max`, and `clear`. You know, like in all other normal programming languages.
2. Experimental fix for the [loop variable capture](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/LoopvarExperiment), one of the [most common Go mistakes](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CommonMistakes).
3. [Profile-guided optimization](https://go.dev/doc/pgo) is now stable. The Go compiler itself now uses it to make its code 10% faster.
4. [Structured logging](https://pkg.go.dev/log/slog), with both human-readable and JSON output. For me personally it 100% replaces any third-party logging libraries.
5. Generic functions for [slices](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/slices) and [maps](https://tip.golang.org/pkg/maps).
6. WASI support. WASI is the standard of defining system calls in WebAssembly.

That's a short list but every item on it is amazing. I hope they'll pick [enums](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19814) (or [union types](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/19412), about the same thing, as Rust shows) next, [the most requested Go feature](https://github.com/golang/go/issues?q=is%3Aissue+sort%3Areactions-%2B1-desc+is%3Aopen) at the moment.
