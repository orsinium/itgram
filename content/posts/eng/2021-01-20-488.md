Morning reading:
ðŸ“„ [Amazon: NOT OK - why we had to change Elastic licensing](https://www.elastic.co/blog/why-license-change-AWS). A post from Elastic team about how AWS uses ES without getting in touch with them.

Some moments, like trademark usage and twits about collaborations aren't ok for sure, some moments are questionable. If from the licensing perspective all is good, AWS doesn't own them anything. Sad but true, this is your decision what license to use and you should expect someone to use all permissions you give in it. On the other hand, when you provide a service, exclusively based on some third-party project, on such scale, you'd better provide some kind of support for the creators, regardless if they are a company or one lonely developer making a small pet-project on evenings.
