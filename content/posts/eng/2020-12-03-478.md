[üêç pympler](https://pympler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a Python library for quick debugging of memory leaks. The idea is simple: record objects size and count before running a function, run the function, find the diff, show the new objects. For "pure" functions no new objects should be created. The tool is quite powerful, it even has a Tk-based interface because why not.
