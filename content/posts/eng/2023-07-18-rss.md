To make all my content accessible, I've provided source, website, and RSS for every project I have:

+ 🐿 ITGram: [🌐 website](https://itgram.orsinium.dev/), [📶 rss](https://itgram.orsinium.dev/index.xml), [📢 telegram](https://t.me/s/itgram_channel), [📄 source](https://github.com/orsinium/itgram).
+ 🐍 Python etc: [🌐 website](https://pythonetc.orsinium.dev/), [📶 rss](https://pythonetc.orsinium.dev/index.xml), [📢 telegram](https://t.me/s/pythonetc), [📄 source](https://github.com/life4/pythonetc).
+ ✏️ Blog: [🌐 website](https://blog.orsinium.dev/), [📶 rss](https://blog.orsinium.dev/index.xml), [📄 source](https://github.com/orsinium/blog).

I had to do quite a few changes for that:

The blog is now powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme which provides RSS out of the box. Before it was powered by home-grown [chameleon](https://github.com/life4/chameleon) engine but now I'm moving everything possible to static sites because how easy it is [to deploy things on netlify](https://t.me/itgram_channel/570).

For ITGram, I exported all posts with [a Python script I found online](https://github.com/progxaker/tg2obsidian/blob/main/tg2md.py) and then cleaned up with a bunch of ad-hoc scripts. It's also served by Hugo and PaperMod, and for publishing posts back into Telegram I made a short script on top of [telethon](https://github.com/LonamiWebs/Telethon).

Finally, Python etc was always Markdown-first. It has lots of custom logic, so PaperMod won't fit. I generate the website with [Jinja2](https://github.com/pallets/jinja/) and a bunch of custom scripts. For RSS, I considered [python-feedgen](https://github.com/lkiesow/python-feedgen) and [rfeed](https://github.com/svpino/rfeed). The former is more popular but I picked the latter because the example in the readme is easier to understand.
