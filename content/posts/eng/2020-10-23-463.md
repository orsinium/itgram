ðŸŽ¥ [Clean Code lectures from Uncle Bob](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUxszVpqZTNShoypLQW9a4dEcffsoZT4k) ("Coding Better World Together") are amazing. It's a great walkthrough on writing maintainable code, ethics of programming, testing, refactoring, automating things, keeping balance between "fast" and "good". Examples are on Java but ideas in all other languages are pretty much the same. Definitely must-watch.
