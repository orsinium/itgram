[STEALING UR FEELINGS](https://stealingurfeelin.gs/) is an interactive movie about privacy and machine learning that shows you exactly how ML can be used to steal your privacy. I highly recommend you show it to your non-IT friends and family members. Don't worry, though, it doesn't steal anything itself (I hope), [it's open-source](https://github.com/noahlevenson/stealing-ur-feelings).
