If your project is vendor locked on Google Cloud (don't get me started), there are a few helpful third-party projects to survive:

+ [fake-gcs-server](https://github.com/fsouza/fake-gcs-server) — emulator for GCS (Storage), available on Docker Hub.
+ [gcloud-pubsub-emulator](https://github.com/marcelcorso/gcloud-pubsub-emulator) — emulator for pubsub, also available on Docker Hub.
+ [gcloud-aio](https://github.com/talkiq/gcloud-aio) — asyncio Python SDK for some Google Cloud services.
