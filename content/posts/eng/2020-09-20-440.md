+ [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) — CLI JSON processor written on С. Allows to extract data from JSON, modify it, supports math, variables, regexes, even has a lot of built-in functions. Installable from Debian repositories.

+ [jqplay.org](https://jqplay.org/) — online playground for jq. Great to try it, debug expressions, have a handy cheat sheet.

+ [gjson](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson) — must-have Go library to get values from a complex deeply nested JSON. Has a simple and intuitive [syntax](https://github.com/tidwall/gjson/blob/master/SYNTAX.md).

+ [jj](https://github.com/tidwall/jj) — CLI tool written on Go, wrapper around gjson. Hence less powerful than jq but much simpler and more friendly.
