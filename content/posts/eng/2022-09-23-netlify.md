ðŸ”§[netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is quite cool. It's a hosting for static websites with a lot of nice features, like custom domains, automatic integration with Github (provides CI and previews), automatically renewed let's encrypt certificates, configuration-as-code. I use it for all my open-source websites ([wps.orsinium.dev](https://wps.orsinium.dev/), [orsinium.dev](https://orsinium.dev/), [svg.orsinium.dev](https://svg.orsinium.dev/), [gweb.orsinium.dev](https://gweb.orsinium.dev/), you got the idea), and I'm quite far from running out of quotas they provide for free accounts.

I avoided for quite a long time all static website hostings because I thought they only can serve whatever HTML you already have in the repo. No, netlify can also build the pages. For each build, it spawns an Ubuntu Docker image with a lot of stuff already installed (like Python and Go) and calls whatever custom command you've provided (which can be a shell script if you have a complex build logic). For example, in [svg-playground](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg-playground), the [netlify.toml](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg-playground/blob/master/netlify.toml) tells to run [netlify.sh](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg-playground/blob/master/netlify.sh) which installs and runs [task](https://taskfile.dev/). And task executes [Taskfile.yaml](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg-playground/blob/master/Taskfile.yaml) which does quite a few things, producing at the end all HTML pages and WASM binary. That could be fewer files if you want but I felt like being more verbose there.
