Registration for [Hacktoberfest 2022](https://hacktoberfest.com/) is open. Hacktoberfest is yearly event when you get some swag (T-shirt+stickers, or donation for planting a tree) for submitting 4 PRs to open-source projects during October.

[Hacktoberfest 2020 had a lot of spam](https://t.me/itgram_channel/448), so this year the initiative got some improvements, even more than in 2021:

1. Maintainers also will receive swag for reviewing and triaging Hacktoberfest PRs.
2. If 2 of your PRs are marked as spam, you automatically blocked.
3. You have to press 4 different checkboxes that you acknowledge the previous point.
