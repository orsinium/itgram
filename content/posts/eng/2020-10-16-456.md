[The Go compiler needs to be smarter](https://lemire.me/blog/2020/06/04/the-go-compiler-needs-to-be-smarter/) â€” a short article why Go compiler sucks. Well, things not so bad, don't listen to me. Go is fast and cool, every release brings a lot of performance improvements, especially for garbage collector. However, there are still many things to do, especially if compare to old big compilers like gcc or clang. For instance, [PGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profile-guided_optimization) and [JIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation) are hard to implement but can give an amazing speed improvement, and there are no such things in Go yet. Well, there is [gccgo](https://golang.org/doc/install/gccgo) compiler for go but [it is slower than gc](https://meltware.com/2019/01/16/gccgo-benchmarks-2019.html).
