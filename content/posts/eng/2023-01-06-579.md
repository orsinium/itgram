ðŸŽ¥ [Make Illegal States Unrepresentable](https://youtu.be/PSh7JUfDstE) is a beginner-friendly talk about writing good type annotations. The speaker covers what is type safety and illegal states, why it matters, and shows three techniques how to achieve that. Examples are on Scala, but can be translated to Python, Rust, or TypeScript. Not to Go, sorry, no algebraic types and atoms for you.
