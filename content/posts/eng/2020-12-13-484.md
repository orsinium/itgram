ðŸ“„[Cohesion](https://vanderburg.org/blog/2011/01/31/cohesion.html) is a good explanation what "cohesion" means. I often use this term as well as coupling and indeed it is harder to explain. I usually show it on examples. Relation between function "sin" and "sort" is really loose and they are meant to be separate packages while "sin" and "cos" are about the same, should be in the same package and can share common implementation.
