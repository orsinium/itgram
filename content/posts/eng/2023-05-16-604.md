📝 [I investigated the Underground Economy of Glassdoor Reviews](https://redd.it/13ilm03) is an unexpectedly detailed post about how companies buy online reviews on Glassdoor and similar platforms. The author contacted freelancers providing such services, aggregated their quotes and services, asked some "hows", and built interesting charts for a few random companies. The research perhaps lacks scale, but still, quite an interesting rabbit hole.
