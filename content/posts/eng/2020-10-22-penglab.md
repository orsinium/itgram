ðŸ“„[penglab](https://github.com/mxrch/penglab) â€” Google Colab notebook with a few hash cracking tools in case you need it on a CTF.

[ðŸ“„ colabcat](https://github.com/someshkar/colabcat) â€” Google Colab notebook with hashcat only but syncing with Google Drive.

And of course, remeber about our best friend, [SecLists](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists). It is a collection of common credentials, filenames, urls, and so on. Maybe, not big enough to crack something serious but good enough for CTFs and [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/).
