ðŸ”§[directus](https://directus.io/) is a powerful and user-friendly WebUI panel for a database. It connects to any SQL database, and provides UI for creating tables and fields, viewing and managing records, webhooks, REST API, 2FA, audit logs, versioning, roles, import and export, custom dashboards, and a lot of other stuff. The best thing you can get if you need a friendly, almost-zero-config, admin panel.

There is also [nocodb](https://github.com/nocodb/nocodb) but it feels more like a spreadsheet rather than an admin panel. The biggest feature they are proud of (and what makes it better for some cases than Directus) is a bunch of integrations for automating workflow. It also has some quite specific representations for data, like kanban, calendar, file view, gallery. Depending on what you need, also worth checking out.
