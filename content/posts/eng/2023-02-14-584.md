üìù [Golang is evil on shitty networks](https://withinboredom.info/blog/2022/12/29/golang-is-evil-on-shitty-networks/) is another reminder that networking is messy. The blog post and the related [GitHub issue](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/5242) got some traction, and there are answers to it on the orange site from [Russ Cox](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34181846) (the author of the code in question) and [John Nagle](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34180239) (the author of the algorithm). It all together is a very interesting reading on networking issues and how it is solved in TCP.
