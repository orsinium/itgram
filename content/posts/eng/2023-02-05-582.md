[Hosting SQLite databases on Github Pages](https://phiresky.github.io/blog/2021/hosting-sqlite-databases-on-github-pages/) is a blog post about how to run SQLite on the frontend. SQLite gets compiled into WebAssembly and the author implemented a virtual FS ([sql.js-httpvfs](https://github.com/phiresky/sql.js-httpvfs)) that serves the database in chunks instead of downloading the whole database at once. Apparently, for it all to work well, you need either a small DB or good indices that allow to get all information needed without fetching the whole database.
