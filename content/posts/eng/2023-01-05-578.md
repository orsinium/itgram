[ðŸ”§ d2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2) is a CLI tool (written on Go) for generating diagrams from a text definition of what is related to what and how. If you know what is PlantUML, MermaidJS, or GraphViz, it's the same, but a bit friendlier. For example:

```block1 -> block2: text on arrow
block2 -> block3
block4```

If you want more examples, the authors maintain a [text-to-diagram.com](https://text-to-diagram.com/) website that compares D2 to similar tools.

I tried it for a few projects, and that's what I'm going to use from now on for all diagrams. It's easy to install, has a nice syntax, and gives quite a nice output. There is no way to apply a custom style to group of elements (like `class` in CSS), but other than that it's fine. When you need custom colors or something, you still can do it on per-element basis.
