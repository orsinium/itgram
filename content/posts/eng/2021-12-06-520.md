VSCode team launched [vscode.dev](https://vscode.dev/) â€” an official web instance of vscode allowing to work with any repositories and local files without installing an IDE. See also [this announcement](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/20/vscode-dev). No terminal, no linters, no "go to definition" but hey, better than nothing. I already see it as part of my tooling to quickly browse open-source projects. Or even code from the phone, why not!
