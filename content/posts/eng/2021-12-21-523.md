A few years ago, I made a Go library [genesis](https://github.com/life4/genesis) with some generic functions, mostly inspired by Elixir. And now, [Go 1.18 beta](https://go.dev/blog/go1.18beta1) is available, and it has proper generics! The 1.18 release is already in a few months. I used this opportunity to try the generics and [migrate the project](https://github.com/life4/genesis/pull/5). And it's pretty cool (except one [stack overflow](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/50273) but it will be fixed in the release). If you want to read more about the project history, [I've made a short reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/rlcf1q/genesis_generic_functions_for_go/). So, give [genesis](https://github.com/life4/genesis) a try, it's pretty cool now.
