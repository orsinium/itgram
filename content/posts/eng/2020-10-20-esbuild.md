[ðŸ”§ esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) is a fast JS/TS bundler and minifier, kind of webpack alternative. No, it's really fast, like 10-100 times faster than webpack. It is a new project and supports not all JS (frontenders name it ECMAScript) features, so it can be used not for all projects. But give it a try! Oh, and it is written on our lovely golang.
