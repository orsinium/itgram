GitHub has added [math support in markdown](https://github.blog/2022-05-19-math-support-in-markdown/). Now, you have even fewer excuses to write your own blog engine instead of writing actual blog posts. It always has been my advice to just go with plain GitHub for your first blog. I mean, it has git, ability to contribute, discussions, nice rendering, navigation (file tree), categories (directories), emojis, analytics, and whatever else you might wish for. And all of that with zero configuration.

The math support isn't perfect yet, though. You can find some issues outlined in [Math on GitHub: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly](https://nschloe.github.io/2022/05/20/math-on-github.html). I personally can't say much. I have only one article with math in it ([Normalized compression distance](https://github.com/orsinium/notes/blob/master/notes-other/ncd.md)), and it seems to be perfectly rendered. People always will find some corner-cases when something isn't as good as LaTeX, so don't overthink it.
