Finally got to posting my little open source projects on reddit. I looked at a few alternatives and [cronnit.us](https://cronnit.us/) is pretty good for scheduling posts. It doesn't support flairs yet but otherwise works fine. Especially I like that you can write everything in csv and then just import it.
