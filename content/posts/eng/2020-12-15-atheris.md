üêç [atheris](https://github.com/google/atheris) is a fuzzer for Python code written on C++. It generates random bytes, feeds it into the function and checks if it fails. To cover more cases, it on every run checks the coverage of the tested code. It has an awful undocumented API but you don't need to know much to use it. Atheris has been around for some time but Google open-sourced it only about a month ago.

In general, there are not many fuzzers for Python, so it's a great news. I know only 2 more:

+ [python-afl](https://github.com/jwilk/python-afl)
+ [pythonfuzz](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security-products/analyzers/fuzzers/pythonfuzz)

BTW, the next release of [deal](https://github.com/life4/deal) will have a native support for fuzzers and [hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
