ðŸ¦€ Found it! [assert2](https://github.com/de-vri-es/assert2-rs) solves the problem I described above. You simply write `assert!(a + b > 13)` and if it fails, instead of "something wrong, good luck" it will say "5 + 6 > 13", with nice colors and all. Now my basic set of human-friendly testing for Rust is complete.
