Relatively recently, bloomberg open-sourced [memray](https://github.com/bloomberg/memray) â€” the first memory profiler for Python that doesn't suck. I especially like their [pytest plugin](https://github.com/bloomberg/pytest-memray). I tried it and it works pretty nicely, it already found a few places in my code where memory consumption can be a bit less aggressive.

If you need to profile execution time, [py-spy](https://github.com/benfred/py-spy) is still the best.
