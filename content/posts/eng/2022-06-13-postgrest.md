[postgrest](https://github.com/postgrest/postgrest) serves a JSON REST API on top of an existing PostgreSQL database. It provides authentication, OpenAPI schema, all operations on data, custom queries, and a lot of other cool stuff. Stop manually writing CRUDs for everything, you have other things to do.
