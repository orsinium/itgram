Tomorrow starts [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/). This is yearly online event: you make 4 PRs on GitHub in any repositories and DigitalOcean sends you a nice T-shirt (and a few sticker). This year, you can choose to [plant a tree](https://tree-nation.com/profile/digitalocean) instead of another one swag.

PRs in your own repositories count but you get more karma and love helping projects you use. Have fun!
