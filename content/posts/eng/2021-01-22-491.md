[ðŸ“„ The worst pieces of code I've ever seen](https://www.jesuisundev.com/en/the-worst-pieces-of-code/). TL;DR:

* Think about your readers.
* Keep code consistent.
* The devil can be in dependencies, trust no one.
* Sometimes, it's better just replace all the module is it is too messy.
* Most of articles on writing a good code just cite or re-tell "Clean Code" or "Code complete", so just read these books.

As a side note, I hope the author doesn't read [Reddit comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/kwqkes/). There is a short summary:

* Author doesn't have any experience.
* Author is too emotional
* The problem is small and nothing important.
* The story is made up and never could happen.
* All these issues because it's JS.

Ugh, reddit...
