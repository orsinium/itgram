[typesplainer](https://github.com/typesplainer/typesplainer) is a fun little tool (CLI, vscode/vim extension, and website) for explaining type annotations in a Python code in plain English. I think it has a pretty limited application (if you don't know a specific type, better read [the official docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)). still, might be helpful if you're starting on a project with type annotations but haven't worked with them before.
