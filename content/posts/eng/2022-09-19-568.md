ðŸŽ¥ [Seven Ineffective Coding Habits of Many Programmers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZsHMHukIlJY) by Kevlin Henney ([text summary](https://notes.webutvikling.org/7-ineffective-coding-habits/)). I'm surprised I haven't published it before. A great conference talk about how humans read code, and so how to make your code a bit easier to read and understand.

This talk is what inspired me to create [flake8-length](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/flake8-length) that keeps line length short without compromising readability of messages, and [flake8-comments](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/flake8-comments) that tries to catch useless comments.
