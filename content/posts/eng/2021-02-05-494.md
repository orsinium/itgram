📊 JetBrains has published [The state of Go](https://blog.jetbrains.com/go/2021/02/03/the-state-of-go/) survey results. A few highlights:

+ China 🇨🇳 has the biggest ratio of Go devs, 16%. Then Japan 🇯🇵, Russia 🇷🇺, Ukraine 🇺🇦.

+ Still isn't the most popular language but already in top 10.

+ Used mostly for web apps and CLI tools.

+ 82% of devs on go modules 🎉

+ most popular routers are [gorilla/mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux) and stdlib

+ [gin](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin) web framework is pretty popular, 46%. BTW, that means, more people use [httprouter](https://github.com/julienschmidt/httprouter) than the survey says (16%). Probably, they just don't know that it is in gin under the hood.

+ [testify](https://github.com/stretchr/testify) is used only by 13% of devs. IDK how others survive.
