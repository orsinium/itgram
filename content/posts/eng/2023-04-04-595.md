üêç [Pandas 2.0 is released](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/dev/whatsnew/v2.0.0.html)! The biggest highlight is a support for [pyarrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) instead of numpy as a backend, which gives a better performance and a better support for missing values. A few months ago, there was a great post about it in the pandas blog: [pandas 2.0 and the Arrow revolution](https://datapythonista.me/blog/pandas-20-and-the-arrow-revolution-part-i).

The release notes are a bit too verbose, so I recommend reading this TL;DR instead: [Everything you need to know about pandas 2.0.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/12b7w3y/everything_you_need_to_know_about_pandas_200/).
