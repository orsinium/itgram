Today I want to tell you a bit about [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/). It's like [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) but for [Elixir](https://t.me/itgram_channel/521). And it is a bit of an understatement because Livebook is so much better. There are many reasons for it: Elixir is concurrent, they built the tool based on the negative and positive experiences of Jupyter, they already had a great Phoenix web framework to build it, and the team behind it are the go authors themselves. They fixed a lot of Jupyter issues, including out-of-order cell execution, custom widgets, and nice markdown rendering.

Livebook is a part of a bigger initiative of Elixir authors to bring Elixir into the world of ML, and they are doing great. There is [nx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx) for tenors, [explorer](https://github.com/elixir-nx/explorer) for dataframe, [axon](https://github.com/elixir-nx/axon) for neural networks, and many other promising projects. And I think functional programming fits ML and datascience just great, much better than the messy world of OOP, mutations, and global states.
