[This code does not exist](https://doesnotexist.codes/) randomly pops snippets of C++ code either real (from debian packages source) or [GPT-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-2)-generated. Try to guess which one is real.

[Hell is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Exit) the code of other people ðŸ‘€
