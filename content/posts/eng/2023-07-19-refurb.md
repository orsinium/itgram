[refurb](https://github.com/dosisod/refurb) is yet another linter for Python. What makes it special is that it internally runs as a mypy plugin. This gives the linter static information about types for everything. As a result, refurb can give more precise and reliable suggestions. But of course it also means refurb is slower than something like [pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle) which works on regular expressions or [ruff](https://t.me/itgram_channel/596) which is written on Rust and works only with AST.
