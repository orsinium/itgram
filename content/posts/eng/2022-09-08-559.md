Today I learned that [you can import a CSV file into SQLite](https://til.simonwillison.net/sqlite/one-line-csv-operations) and then use it to run SQL queries on the data you have. I often feel that it would be easier to just run a short SQL query than try to craft some monstrosity with pandas. Now I know exactly how. Also, in the [original issue](https://github.com/multiprocessio/dsq/issues/70) someone posted a bash function for convenience:

```# Usage: cq <csv_file> [<table>]
cq() {
  local csv_file="${1:?Usage: cq <csv_file> [<table>]}" table="${2:-T}"
  sqlite3 -interactive -cmd '.headers on' -cmd '.prompt "\nsqlite> "' \
    -cmd '.mode csv' -cmd ".import '$csv_file' '$table'" -cmd ".mode column"
}```
