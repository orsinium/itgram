Today I've got access to [GitHub Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) preview. This is the biggest thing of the year! I just started to use it, and it already writes code for me. It's not a garbage like tabnine that finds you StackOverflow snippets of sorting functions or whatever, oh no, copilot knows the context of the current file.
