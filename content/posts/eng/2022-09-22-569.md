üêç I've made [svg.orsinium.dev](https://svg.orsinium.dev/). It's an online playground for [svg.py](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/svg.py), and it has quite a potential. You can generate images in your browser. It's like [processing](https://processing.org/) but it's Python! Unfortunately, I there is no autocomplete in it (yet?), and a nice autocomplete is the whole point of <https://svg.py>. Still, quite useful for debugging your art.

The <https://svg.py> turned out to be more useful for me than I expected, TBH. I've created it to draw cards for my board game, and I still didn't get to it, shame on me. But despite of this, I already have used <https://svg.py> in [punchline](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/punchline) for producing punch stripes for my music box, and in [generative-art](https://github.com/orsinium-labs/generative-art) which has only 4 images so far, but I hope it to grow.
