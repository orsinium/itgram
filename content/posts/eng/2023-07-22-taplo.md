[taplo](https://taplo.tamasfe.dev/) is a CLI tool (and a Rust library) for working with TOML. It can check TOML files for syntax errors, validate them against JSON schemas, and format.

The best thing about it is the [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) VSCode plugin wrapping taplo that provides all the same things as CLI plus smart syntax highlighting, navigation, refactoring, and even autocomplete for `pyproject.toml`, `fly.toml`, `Cargo.toml` and [a few other formats]([autocomplete](https://github.com/tamasfe/taplo/tree/master/site/site/public/schemas)).
