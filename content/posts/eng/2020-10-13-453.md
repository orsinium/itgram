[mtproto](https://github.com/xelaj/mtproto) â€” full pure Go implementation of MTProto protocol. That means, you can automate anything in Telegram for your account (not bots).

We need more pure Go libraries because Go is amazing. Using wrappers around C libs means much heavier introspection, benchmarking, and cross-compilation and slower interoperation.

I nominate this repository for "most insane README of the year".
