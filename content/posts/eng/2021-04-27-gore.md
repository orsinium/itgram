For a long time, I was looking for a good REPL for Go. I tried [gore](https://github.com/motemen/gore), [gomacro](https://github.com/cosmos72/gomacro), and a few similar solutions, but it all so clumsy. And so I found it.

[gophernotes](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes) is a Go core for Jupyter Notebooks (I use it with [Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab/), it's all the same). It misses documentation and type signature discovery ([#173](https://github.com/gopherdata/gophernotes/issues/173)) but still better than everything else I tried so far.
