ðŸ“„ [Crypto miners are killing free CI](https://layerci.com/blog/crypto-miners-are-killing-free-ci/). The title pretty much says it. Inside also a few examples how exactly people exploit CIs. This is a good example of [tragedy of commons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons). Some people for a relatively small amount of money spend a lot of resources, killing CI, world, raising prices to hardware etc. "This is why we can't have nice things". CI services are fighting back: Gitlab recently reduced their free quotas, GitHub Actions requires to manually allow CI runs for the first time contributors. It doesn't solve the problem but it is still something.
