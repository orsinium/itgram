[Debugging Go in prod using eBPF](https://blog.pixielabs.ai/blog/ebpf-function-tracing/post/) is a fun article about inserting a breakpoint into a working binary on Go (on any language, actually) and tracking value in a function. It helps debug on production, like in Elixir or Nodejs. It wouldn't help much if you want to track a bit more than one value in one place but it's a good start.

The post is a kind of pre-announce of [Pixie](https://pixielabs.ai/). This is going to be a tool that will allow you to track values and debug on production. In particular, they are targeted on k8s, for whatever reason. Their scripting language [PxL](https://docs.pixielabs.ai/pxl/) is... Well, it is Python.
