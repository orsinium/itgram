I've stumbled across the work of [Ray Toal](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/), and there is a lot to explore. I wish I had lectures like this in my university. Algorithms, data structures, databases, programming languages, security, networking, and much more.

I especially like [Computer Language Semantics](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/classes/pls/). He covers [what is syntax](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/syntax/), [syntax design](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/syntaxdesign/), and has good introductions to many languages with lots of examples (for example, to [Clojure](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/introclojure/)). Quite a good way to get started with a new language when you already know some programming. He also published a book [Programming Language Explorations](https://rtoal.github.io/ple/) which, I think, is based on these courses. He published a [ple GitHub repo](https://github.com/rtoal/ple) for the book with examples of programs on each language he covers (and that's a lot of languages). Also, [the book landing page](https://rtoal.github.io/ple/) links a few similar resources, like [Syntax Across Languages](http://rigaux.org/language-study/syntax-across-languages.html), a big page that compares how the syntax for different things (like function call) looks like in different languages. And he also provides [this overview page](https://rtoal.github.io/ple/overviews.html) of different languages, with a short description, application examples, links, and tags.

But there is more cool stuff, I can't reasonably cover it in a single post. For example, this [guide on clean code](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/cleancode/). Or [intro to command line](https://cs.lmu.edu/~ray/notes/commandline/). As I said, a lot to uncover. I recommend you to go right to his home page and find yourself what resonates with you:
