üìù[How Software Companies Die](https://homepages.uc.edu/~thomam/Articles/HowSoftwareCompaniesDie.pdf). How is it written in 28 years ago and describes all the places I worked in? In 1995, I was busy non-existing. I don't think it's how companies die, though. More like how software products turn into unmaintainable pile of garbage. And garbage products can sell just fine. [Take Jira for example](https://t.me/itgram_channel/562).
