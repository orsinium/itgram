My favorite videos about Elixir:

+ [Elixir: The Documentary](https://youtu.be/lxYFOM3UJzo) — a bit of Elixir history, motivation to write a new language.
+ [Idioms for building fault-tolerant applications with Elixir](https://youtu.be/oxtMN-A44k8) — a deeper dive into why Elixir exists, what it solves, how it's different from Erlang.
+ [The Soul of Erlang and Elixir](https://youtu.be/JvBT4XBdoUE) — an interesting demo of Elixir features that make it different: hot code reload, observability, supervision, concurrency.
+ [Intro to OTP in Elixir](https://youtu.be/CJT8wPnmjTM) — a guide into concurrency patterns and error handling.
+ [Elixir Tutorial](https://youtu.be/pBNOavRoNL0) — very basics of the language: syntax, types, pattern matching.

And if you want to properly learn the language, I highly recommend [Elixir School](https://elixirschool.com/en/).
