[An Animated Introduction to Elixir](https://markm208.github.io/exbook/). This is a guide into Elixir with quite an interesting format. Each chapter is build around a code example (similar to [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/)) and when you press the "play" button, you see how the code changes a bit, and on the left there is an explanation for the change, with links and images. Beautiful! It only works on desktop, though.
