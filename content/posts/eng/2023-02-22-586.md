üìù [Functional Programming in C++](http://sevangelatos.com/john-carmack-on/) is a (mirror of) blog post from John Carmack about using functional approach in, well, any OOP language, actually, not just C++. I like how well-thought, practical, and balanced his vision on this. He covers pure functions and immutability, their trade offs, and how to fit into the messy OOP world. I think it's a good intro into the world of functional programming, just enough to get interested and already start using it at work.
