[Font Awesome 6.0.0 is released](https://blog.fontawesome.com/font-awesome-6-2/). [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) is a pretty cool collection of web icons, packed as a font and used through a CSS file that adds a class for each icon. For example, this is how you can add a Python icon:

```<i class="fa-brands fa-python"></i>```

(or "fab" instead of "fa-brands" in older versions or if you want to save a few bytes)

There are many alternatives, like [icomoon](https://icomoon.io/), that allow you to generate your own small font instead of bringing on the prod thousands of icons you will never use. But, apparently, Font Awesome is just easier to use. Like, who cares if your blog downloads 10 Kb or 130 Kb font, nobody visits it anyway.

On the negative side, a few years ago they started to require registration to get the CDN URL. But don't worry, I got you covered:

```<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.0.0/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-3B6NwesSXE7YJlcLI9RpRqGf2p/EgVH8BgoKTaUrmKNDkHPStTQ3EyoYjCGXaOTS" crossorigin="anonymous">```

To upgrade, just replace the version number and then regenerate the integrity hash:

```curl https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v6.0.0/css/all.css | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl base64 -A```
