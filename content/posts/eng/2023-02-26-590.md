[Stop Writing Dead Programs](https://youtu.be/8Ab3ArE8W3s) is a great talk about some legacy features that modern programming languages keep (and so we keep using them) from the times of punchcards.

I'd a bit argue with the ending, though. I believe in visual programming languages too but I think it's quite a big leap there from how we program now. Some people go all-in for visual languages, some say to [always bet on text](https://graydon2.dreamwidth.org/193447.html). I think the trick is to find the balance there, and the next big language is something like [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) (with visual representation of high-level flow and text representation of logic inside of each function) rather than [Enso](https://enso.org/) where everything is visualized. I'd like to see better structure and navigation for modules and functions, as it was in [smalltalk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk), and more interactive development, as it was in [lisp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)). The ideas aren't new, we just need to get them back into modern languages. I'm currently deceiving a plan to get [Livebook](https://livebook.dev/) (Jupyter but better and for Elixir) to that level ðŸ¤”
