[ziglings](https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings), [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings), and [gopherlings](https://github.com/soypat/gopherlings) are tutorials for learning Zig, Rust and Go respectively by fixing bugs in tiny broken programs. It's great when you need some practice in a new language but don't have an idea or time for a proper project.
