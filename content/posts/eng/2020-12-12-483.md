ðŸ“ŠðŸ”§ [Everything You Always Wanted To Know About GitHub](https://gh.clickhouse.tech/explorer/). ClickHouse team took the whole GitHub archive, put it into one ClickHouse database, collected all possible stat on top of it and framed it into an article. However, the most amazing thing is that [you can run your custom queries](https://gh-api.clickhouse.tech/play)! For example, this is how I queried which my repositories in which months received most stars:

```SELECT
  repo_name,
  count() AS stars,
  toYear(created_at) as year,
  toMonth(created_at) AS month
FROM github_events
WHERE event_type = 'WatchEvent'
  AND (
    repo_name LIKE '%dephell%'
    OR repo_name LIKE '%life4/%'
    OR repo_name LIKE '%orsinium%')
GROUP BY repo_name, year, month
ORDER BY stars DESC
LIMIT 50```

And this is who liked most of my projects (yes, it's me):

```SELECT
  actor_login as username,
  count() AS stars
FROM github_events
WHERE event_type = 'WatchEvent'
  AND (
    repo_name LIKE '%dephell%'
    OR repo_name LIKE '%life4/%'
    OR repo_name LIKE '%orsinium%')
GROUP BY username
ORDER BY stars DESC
LIMIT 50```
